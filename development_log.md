# VectorShift Technical Assessment Development Log

This file documents the step-by-step process of completing the VectorShift frontend technical assessment.

## Overview
The assessment consists of four main tasks:
1. Create a node abstraction
2. Style the components
3. Enhance the Text node functionality
4. Integrate with the backend

## Development Timeline

### Initial Setup - May 30, 2025
- Analyzed the project structure and requirements
- Identified the four existing node types and their shared patterns
- Created this development log

### Part 1: Node Abstraction - May 30, 2025
- Created a BaseNode component as an abstraction for all nodes
- Refactored the existing nodes (InputNode, LLMNode, OutputNode, TextNode) to use the BaseNode
- Created five new node types to demonstrate the flexibility of the abstraction
- Added the new node types to the toolbar and UI
- The abstraction handles:
  - Common styling and layout
  - Dynamic input/output handle rendering
  - Node header and content structure
  - Consistent props interface

#### BaseNode Component Design
The BaseNode component takes the following props:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the node
- `data`: Node data from ReactFlow
- `children`: Content to render inside the node
- `nodeType`: Type label to display in the header
- `width` and `height`: Dimensions of the node (with defaults)
- `inputs`: Array of input handle configurations
- `outputs`: Array of output handle configurations

#### Five New Node Types Created
1. **DataProcessorNode**: Processes data with operations like Filter, Sort, Transform, and Aggregate
   - Takes a single input and produces a single output
   - Configurable processor type

2. **DatabaseNode**: Represents database operations
   - Support for different database types (SQL, NoSQL, Graph, Vector)
   - Different actions (Query, Insert, Update, Delete)
   - Dynamic inputs/outputs based on action type

3. **APINode**: Handles API requests
   - Configurable HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Dynamic inputs based on method type
   - Custom endpoint configuration

4. **ConditionalNode**: Implements conditional logic
   - One input, two outputs (true/false branches)
   - Customizable condition expression

5. **FileNode**: Manages file operations
   - Operations include Read, Write, Append
   - Dynamic inputs/outputs based on operation
   - Configurable file path

## Completed

### Part 1: Node Abstraction ✓
Created a flexible, reusable node abstraction and demonstrated its effectiveness by implementing five new node types.

### Part 2: Styling - May 30, 2025 ✓
- Created a comprehensive styling system in `styles.js` with:
  - Consistent color palette with primary, secondary, and node-specific colors
  - Typography system with font families, sizes, and weights
  - Spacing system for consistent margins and padding
  - Shadows and border radius constants for unified appearance
  - Component-specific styling templates
- Improved the application layout with:
  - Modern header and sidebar design
  - Responsive ReactFlow canvas
  - Better organization of node types in the toolbar
- Enhanced visual elements:
  - Color-coded nodes by type for better visual distinction
  - Improved handle styling and connection lines
  - Better form element styling (inputs, selects, etc.)
  - Added visual feedback for interactions (hover effects, etc.)

### Part 3: Enhancing the Text Node - May 30, 2025 ✓
- Implemented dynamic sizing for the Text Node:
  - Width adjusts based on text length (between 220px and 400px)
  - Height adjusts based on content lines and number of variable handles
  - Changed input field to textarea for better text editing
- Added variable detection and dynamic handle creation:
  - Parses text for variables in double curly braces (e.g., `{{variableName}}`)
  - Creates input handles on the left side for each detected variable
  - Updates handles in real-time as text changes
  - Shows visual feedback listing detected variables

### Part 4: Backend Integration - May 30, 2025 ✓
- Updated the backend (`main.py`):
  - Changed endpoint from GET to POST to receive pipeline data
  - Added CORS middleware to allow requests from frontend
  - Implemented logic to count nodes and edges
  - Added algorithm to check if the graph is a DAG using NetworkX
  - Created proper response format with num_nodes, num_edges, and is_dag
- Enhanced the frontend submit functionality:
  - Connected Submit button to send pipeline data to backend
  - Added loading state and error handling
  - Implemented user-friendly alert to display results
  - Shows number of nodes, edges, and whether the pipeline is a valid DAG

### UI Color Improvements - May 30, 2025 ✓
- Enhanced visibility and differentiation of node boxes:
  - Implemented a dark purple theme with light purple accents to match VectorShift branding
  - Created a consistent color system with gradients and glow effects
  - Updated color variables in `styles.js` with new gradient options:
    - `lightPurple`: Linear gradient from `#8a5cf5` to `#c27ff8`
    - `purple`: Linear gradient from `#7928ca` to `#b346ff`
    - `subtle`: Semi-transparent light purple gradient for backgrounds
    - `glow`: Radial gradient for subtle highlighting effects
- Improved node styling for better visibility:
  - Added gradient backgrounds to nodes: `linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(65, 65, 120, 0.9) 0%, rgba(45, 45, 85, 0.9) 100%)`
  - Implemented colored headers for each node type using 40% opacity of node type color
  - Enhanced node borders with gradient effects: `borderImage: linear-gradient(to bottom, ${nodeTypeColor}, rgba(137, 92, 245, 0.5)) 1`
  - Added glow box-shadow: `0 8px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4), 0 0 15px rgba(137, 92, 245, 0.2)`
- Enhanced form elements for better readability:
  - Increased contrast of input fields with `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)` background
  - Added purple-accented borders: `border: 1px solid rgba(194, 127, 248, 0.5)`
  - Customized select dropdowns with white arrow icons for better visibility
  - Improved focus states with purple glow: `box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px rgba(161, 59, 245, 0.3)`
- Improved connection visibility:
  - Styled handles with larger size (12px) and light purple glow
  - Enhanced edge paths with increased width (3px) and drop shadow
  - Added hover transform effects for handles
  - Matched connection colors to the VectorShift purple theme
- Created custom styling for the variables section in Text nodes:
  - Added purple accented border and background
  - Styled variable items with bullet points and hover effects
  - Used CSS classes for consistent styling across components
- Added ambient background effects:
  - Created subtle radial gradient glows in the corners of the canvas
  - Implemented inset shadows for depth
  - Used semi-transparent overlays to create a layered effect

## All Tasks Completed ✓

The VectorShift Technical Assessment has been successfully completed with all requirements implemented:
1. Created a flexible node abstraction and five new node types
2. Applied a comprehensive styling system for a polished UI
3. Enhanced the Text Node with dynamic sizing and variable detection
4. Integrated with the backend to validate the pipeline structure
5. Improved UI colors with a VectorShift-inspired purple/dark theme for better visibility

Next potential improvements:
- Add more sophisticated error handling
- Implement more node types
- Add pipeline execution capabilities
- Create a more advanced visualization for validation results
