# Pipeline_Builder
VectorShift Pipeline Builder is a React-based web application that enables users to design complex data processing pipelines using a visual, drag-and-drop interface. Inspired by visual programming tools, it allows users to connect various node types to create directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that represent data workflows.
